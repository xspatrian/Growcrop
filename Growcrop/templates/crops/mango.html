      Mango, often hailed as the king of fruits, is a tropical fruit with global popularity and significance. Mango trees
      are cultivated in various regions worldwide for their delicious and nutritious fruits, which are enjoyed fresh,
      processed into juices, jams, and desserts, and used in culinary dishes. Mango cultivation encompasses diverse
      varieties, each with its unique flavor, texture, and culinary uses. From the sprawling orchards of South Asia to
      the sunny plantations of Latin America and beyond, mango cultivation represents a rich tapestry of agricultural
      practices, traditions, and cultural significance. For farmers, mango cultivation provides not only a source of
      income but also a deep connection to the land and a way of life passed down through generations. This
      introduction explores the art of mango cultivation, delving into the methods, challenges, and significance of
      growing this beloved fruit for communities around the world.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Mango cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce high-quality fruits. Mango trees
      thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, characterized by warm temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons.
      The following are key environmental factors required for successful mango cultivation:
      <br><br>

      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Mango trees require warm temperatures for optimal growth and fruit production. Ideal temperatures range between
        25째C to 35째C (77째F to 95째F), with cooler temperatures during the flowering and fruiting stages promoting better
        fruit set and development.
        <br><br>

        <li>Water:</li>
        Adequate water availability is crucial for mango trees, particularly during flowering, fruit development, and
        ripening. While mango trees are relatively drought-tolerant once established, regular irrigation is essential,
        especially during dry periods, to ensure optimal fruit yield and quality.
        <br><br>

        <li>Soil:</li>
        Mango trees thrive in well-drained, fertile soils with good water-holding capacity. Sandy loam or loamy soils
        with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.5 are ideal for mango cultivation. Proper soil drainage is essential to prevent
        waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and other diseases.
        <br><br>

        <li>Sunlight:</li>
        Mango trees require full sun exposure to thrive and produce high-quality fruits. Adequate sunlight promotes
        photosynthesis, fruit development, and sugar accumulation in the fruits. Planting mango trees in open, sunny
        locations ensures maximum sunlight exposure throughout the day.
        <br><br>

        <li>Humidity:</li>
        Mango trees prefer moderately humid conditions, typically ranging from 60% to 80% relative humidity. While they
        can tolerate brief periods of low humidity, prolonged dry conditions can affect flowering, fruit set, and fruit
        quality. Proper mulching and irrigation help maintain soil moisture and humidity levels in mango orchards.
        <br><br>

        <li>Rainfall:</li>
        Mango trees require well-distributed rainfall, particularly during the flowering and fruiting stages, to ensure
        optimal fruit set and development. In regions with seasonal rainfall patterns, irrigation may be necessary during
        dry periods to supplement moisture requirements and prevent water stress.

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">

      Mango trees are susceptible to various insect pests, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Mango Fruit Fly:</li> Adults lay eggs in developing mango fruits, leading to fruit damage and spoilage.
        <li>Mango Hoppers:</li> Nymphs and adults feed on mango leaves and young shoots, causing defoliation and
        stunted growth.
        <li>Mango Seed Weevil:</li> Larvae bore into mango seeds, causing damage and reducing seed viability.
        <li>Mango Shoot Borer:</li> Larvae tunnel into mango shoots and stems, causing wilting and dieback of branches.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in mango cultivation. Farmers utilize a range
      of insecticides, fungicides, and miticides to protect mango trees from pests and ensure optimal fruit yield and
      quality.
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">


      Mango trees benefit from balanced fertilization to support healthy growth and fruit production. Commonly used
      fertilizers for mango cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Important for vegetative growth, flowering, and fruit development. Nitrogen-rich
        fertilizers such as urea or ammonium sulfate are commonly used to promote healthy foliage and fruit set.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Essential for root development, flowering, and fruiting. Phosphorus fertilizers such
        as diammonium phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate are applied to improve root growth and fruit quality.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to overall tree health, fruit quality, and stress tolerance. Potassium
        fertilizers such as potassium chloride or potassium sulfate are applied to enhance fruit size, sweetness, and
        shelf life.
        <li>Micronutrients:</li> Supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, iron, manganese, and boron may be applied to
        correct nutrient deficiencies and improve mango tree health and productivity.
