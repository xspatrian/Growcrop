      Onions, a staple in culinary dishes worldwide, are grown for their pungent flavor and versatility in cooking.
      Onions come in various colors, shapes, and sizes, and are used in a wide range of cuisines. Cultivated by farmers
      across the globe, onions play a vital role in both commercial agriculture and small-scale farming. From the fields
      of Asia to the farms of Europe and beyond, onion cultivation encompasses diverse practices and traditions. For
      farmers, onions represent not only a source of income but also a cultural heritage passed down through
      generations. This introduction explores the intricacies of onion cultivation, including methods, challenges, and

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Onions require specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Onions prefer cool weather
      and well-drained soil rich in organic matter. The following are key specifications for successful onion
      cultivation:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Onions thrive in cool weather, with temperatures ideally between 13째C to 24째C (55째F to 75째F). Cool temperatures
        promote bulb development and help prevent premature flowering.
        <li>Water:</li>
        Onions require consistent moisture, particularly during bulb formation. However, excessive moisture can lead to
        disease issues, so well-drained soil is essential.
        <li>Soil:</li>
        Onions grow best in loose, well-drained soil with good fertility. Sandy loam or loamy soils with a pH of 6.0 to
        7.5 are ideal for onion cultivation.
        <li>Sunlight:</li>
        Onions need full sun exposure for at least 6 hours a day to promote healthy growth and bulb development.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pests and Diseases</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Onions are susceptible to various pests and diseases that can impact yield and quality. Common pests and diseases
      affecting onions include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Thrips:</li>
        Thrips feed on onion leaves, causing silvering and reducing photosynthesis.
        <li>Onion Maggots:</li>
        Maggots feed on onion roots, causing stunted growth and wilting.
        <li>Downy Mildew:</li>
        Downy mildew is a fungal disease that affects onion foliage, causing yellowing and lesions.
        <li>Botrytis Rot:</li>
        Botrytis rot infects onion bulbs, causing decay and storage losses.
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Management Practices</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Effective management practices are essential for successful onion cultivation. These practices include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Rotation:</li>
        Rotate onion crops with non-allium crops to reduce disease pressure and maintain soil health.
        <li>Weed Control:</li>
        Implement weed control measures to minimize competition and ensure optimal onion growth.
        <li>Irrigation:</li>
        Provide consistent irrigation to onions, ensuring soil moisture levels are adequate for bulb development.
        <li>Fertilization:</li>
        Apply balanced fertilizers to provide essential nutrients for onion growth and bulb formation.
      </ol>
