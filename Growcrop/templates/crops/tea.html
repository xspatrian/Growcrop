    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Tea crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Tea, a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions around the world, is derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis
      plant. Cultivated in regions with suitable environmental conditions, tea production is a labor-intensive process
      that involves careful cultivation, harvesting, and processing of tea leaves to produce a variety of teas with
      distinct flavors and characteristics. From the lush tea gardens of Asia to plantations in Africa and beyond, tea
      cultivation represents a rich tradition with cultural and economic significance. This introduction explores the
      art of tea cultivation, delving into the methods, challenges, and significance of growing this revered crop for
      tea enthusiasts worldwide.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Tea cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. The following are
      key environmental factors required for successful tea cultivation:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Tea plants thrive in moderate temperatures, typically between 10째C to 30째C (50째F to 86째F). The optimal
        temperature range varies depending on the tea variety and growth stage. Moderate temperatures promote healthy
        leaf growth and essential oil production, contributing to tea flavor and aroma.<br><br>

        <li>Water:</li> Adequate water availability is essential for tea cultivation, particularly during the growing
        season. Tea plants require consistent soil moisture, with well-drained soils to prevent waterlogging. While
        tea is tolerant of drought conditions to some extent, supplemental irrigation may be necessary during dry
        periods to ensure optimal plant growth and leaf production.<br><br>

        <li>Soil:</li> Tea plants prefer well-drained, acidic soils rich in organic matter. Ideal soil pH ranges from
        4.5 to 5.5 for optimal tea cultivation. Soil fertility, texture, and structure play crucial roles in tea plant
        health and productivity, with sandy loam soils often considered ideal for tea cultivation.<br><br>

        <li>Sunlight:</li> Tea plants require ample sunlight for photosynthesis and growth. While tea can tolerate
        partial shade, particularly during hot afternoons, full sun exposure is preferable for optimal leaf
        development and tea quality. Adequate sunlight ensures the synthesis of essential compounds responsible for
        tea flavor, aroma, and health benefits.<br><br>

        <li>Humidity:</li> Tea cultivation is favored by moderate to high humidity levels, typically between 60% to
        80%. Humid conditions promote lush leaf growth and reduce water stress on tea plants. However, excessive
        humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases, necessitating proper airflow and management practices to
        maintain optimal humidity levels.<br><br>

        <li>Rainfall:</li> Well-distributed rainfall is crucial for tea cultivation, providing essential moisture
        during the growing season. Tea plants require approximately 1500 to 2500 mm of rainfall annually, with
        rainfall distribution influencing tea yield and quality. Supplemental irrigation may be necessary in regions
        with irregular rainfall patterns to ensure consistent tea production.<br><br>
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Tea crops are susceptible to various insect attacks, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Tea Mosquito Bug:</li> Feeds on tea plant sap, causing leaf withering and reduced tea quality.
        <li>Tea Tortrix Caterpillar:</li> Larvae feed on tender tea shoots, leading to leaf damage and yield loss.
        <li>Red Spider Mites:</li> Suck sap from tea leaves, causing leaf discoloration and reduced photosynthetic
        activity.
        <li>Tea Looper Caterpillar:</li> Larvae feed on tea leaves, causing defoliation and reduced tea quality.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in tea cultivation. Farmers utilize a range
      of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect tea crops from pests and ensure optimal yield and quality.
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      The most suitable fertilizer for tea crop cultivation is often a balanced blend that provides essential nutrients
      required for healthy growth and high yields. Commonly used fertilizers for tea cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Nitrogen is crucial for promoting vigorous tea plant growth and leaf production. It
        enhances tea flavor, aroma, and overall plant health. Urea is a commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in tea
        cultivation.<br><br>

        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Phosphorus supports root development, flowering, and fruiting in tea plants.
        Diammonium phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate are commonly used phosphorus fertilizers in tea
        cultivation.<br><br>

        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Potassium contributes to tea plant vigor, stress tolerance, and disease resistance.
        Muriate of potash (potassium chloride) is a popular potassium fertilizer for tea crops.<br><br>

        <li>Micronutrients:</li> Supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, iron, and manganese may be applied to correct
        deficiencies and improve tea plant health and productivity.
