    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Beets crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Beets, a versatile root crop, are cultivated worldwide for their edible roots and greens. Known for their earthy
      flavor and vibrant colors, beets are used in various culinary dishes, salads, and beverages. Beets are rich in
      essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them a nutritious addition to the
      diet. Cultivated by farmers in diverse climates and regions, beets play a significant role in global agriculture
      and food security. This introduction explores the cultivation, uses, and nutritional benefits of beets, as well
      as the cultural significance of this humble root crop.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Beets cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Beets thrive in
      cool temperatures, typically between 10째C to 20째C (50째F to 68째F). The optimal temperature for beet cultivation
      varies depending on the variety and growth stage. Cool temperatures promote healthy root development and
      enhance sugar content in the roots. Beets are moderately water-intensive crops and require consistent soil
      moisture throughout their growing season. Well-drained, loamy soils with good fertility and organic matter
      content are ideal for beet cultivation. The soil pH should be slightly acidic to neutral, typically between 6.0
      to 7.5, to support optimal nutrient uptake by the beets. Beets are tolerant of partial shade but prefer full sun
      exposure for optimal growth and root development. Adequate sunlight ensures vigorous foliage growth and
      promotes the formation of healthy, flavorful roots. Beets are generally resilient to humidity variations but
      prefer moderate humidity levels for optimal growth and disease resistance. Well-distributed rainfall or
      supplemental irrigation is essential to maintain soil moisture levels during the growing season.

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Beets crops are susceptible to various insect attacks, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Beet Armyworms:</li> Larvae feed on beet leaves, causing defoliation and reduced plant vigor.
        <li>Root Maggots:</li> Larvae feed on beet roots, causing damage and reducing yield.
        <li>Aphids:</li> Sap-sucking insects that weaken beet plants and transmit viral diseases.
        <li>Leaf Miners:</li> Larvae tunnel through beet leaves, leaving distinctive trails and reducing photosynthetic
        activity.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in beet cultivation. Farmers utilize a range
      of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect beet crops from pests and ensure optimal yield and
      quality.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Beets crops benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      yield. Commonly used fertilizers for beet cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Important for foliage growth, root development, and sugar accumulation in the roots.
        Ammonium nitrate or urea are commonly used nitrogen fertilizers in beet cultivation.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Essential for root development, early growth, and overall plant vigor. Diammonium
        phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate are commonly used phosphorus fertilizers in beet cultivation.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to root health, disease resistance, and sugar transport within the plant.
        Muriate of potash (potassium chloride) is a popular potassium fertilizer for beet crops.
        <li>Organic Matter:</li> Incorporating compost, manure, or organic amendments into the soil improves soil
        fertility, structure, and nutrient availability for beet plants.
