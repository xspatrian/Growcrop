    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Wheat crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Wheat, a staple crop with global significance, thrives in diverse environmental conditions, although it has specific
      requirements for optimal growth and yield. Cultivated by millions of farmers worldwide, wheat production sustains
      economies, nourishes populations, and supports livelihoods. From the vast plains of North America to the fields of
      Europe and beyond, wheat cultivation encompasses a rich tapestry of traditions, techniques, and agricultural
      practices handed down through generations. For farmers, wheat cultivation represents not only a means of
      sustenance but also a deeply ingrained cultural heritage and way of life. This introduction explores the intricate
      art of wheat cultivation, delving into the methods, challenges, and significance of growing this vital crop for
      farmers around the world.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Wheat cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Wheat is
      cultivated in a range of temperatures, typically between 15째C to 24째C (59째F to 75째F). The optimal temperature for
      wheat cultivation varies depending on the variety and growth stage. Moderate temperatures promote healthy
      vegetative growth and flowering, while extreme heat or cold can adversely affect yield and grain quality.
      Wheat requires adequate moisture throughout its growing season, with well-distributed rainfall or supplemental
      irrigation. While wheat is less water-intensive compared to rice, it still needs consistent soil moisture,
      especially during critical growth stages such as tillering, flowering, and grain filling. Well-drained soils
      with good water retention capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Wheat grows best in well-drained loamy soils
      with good fertility and structure. Ideal soil pH ranges from slightly acidic to neutral, typically between 6.0 to
      7.5. Wheat crops benefit from soils rich in organic matter, which enhance nutrient availability and soil
      structure, promoting root development and water uptake. Wheat is a sun-loving crop that requires ample sunlight
      for photosynthesis and growth. Full sun exposure is preferable for optimal yield and grain quality. However,
      wheat varieties can tolerate partial shade to some extent, especially in regions with intense heat or drought
      stress. Wheat cultivation is generally less reliant on high humidity levels compared to rice. Moderate humidity
      levels, typically between 40% to 70%, are suitable for wheat growth and development. However, excessively humid
      conditions can increase the risk of fungal diseases, particularly during flowering and grain filling stages.
      Wheat crops rely on well-distributed rainfall during the growing season, although supplemental irrigation may be
      necessary in regions with inadequate rainfall. Excessive moisture, especially during the harvest period, can lead
      to lodging and grain sprouting, negatively impacting yield and quality.

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Wheat crops are susceptible to various insect pests, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Wheat Aphids:</li> Sap-sucking insects that weaken plants and transmit viral diseases.
        <li>Wheat Stem Sawflies:</li> Larvae feed on wheat stems, causing lodging and reduced grain yield.
        <li>Wheat Hessian Flies:</li> Maggots feed on wheat seedlings, causing stunted growth and yield loss.
        <li>Wheat Head Armyworms:</li> Larvae feed on developing wheat heads, leading to reduced grain quality and yield.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in wheat cultivation. Farmers utilize a range
      of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect wheat crops from pests and ensure optimal yield and
      quality.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Wheat crops benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      yield. Commonly used fertilizers for wheat cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Important for promoting vegetative growth, tillering, and grain development. Urea is a
        commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in wheat cultivation.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Essential for root development, flowering, and grain formation. Diammonium phosphate
        (DAP) or triple superphosphate are commonly used phosphorus fertilizers in wheat cultivation.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to overall plant health, stress tolerance, and grain quality. Muriate of
        potash (potassium chloride) is a popular potassium fertilizer for wheat crops.
        <li>Micronutrients:</li> Supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, iron, and boron may be applied to correct
        deficiencies and improve wheat crop health and productivity.
