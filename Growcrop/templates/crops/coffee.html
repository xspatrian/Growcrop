    <h4 class="heading">Types of Coffee</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Coffee comes in a variety of types, each offering unique flavors and characteristics. Some popular types of coffee
      include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Arabica:</li>
        Arabica coffee beans are known for their smooth and mild flavor profile, often featuring hints of fruit and
        floral notes. Cultivated at higher elevations, Arabica beans are prized for their quality and are commonly used
        in specialty coffee blends.<br><br>
        <li>Robusta:</li>
        Robusta coffee beans are renowned for their bold and intense flavor, with higher caffeine content compared to
        Arabica beans. Robusta beans are commonly used in espresso blends and instant coffee due to their strong
        flavor.<br><br>
        <li>Liberica:</li>
        Liberica coffee beans are characterized by their unique and complex flavor profile, often described as fruity and
        floral with a hint of smokiness. Although less common than Arabica and Robusta, Liberica beans are prized by
        enthusiasts for their distinct taste.<br><br>
        <li>Excelsa:</li>
        Excelsa coffee beans are known for their unique and exotic flavor profile, featuring fruity and tart notes with a
        hint of spice. Excelsa beans are commonly used in blends to add complexity and depth to the flavor profile.

    <h4 class="heading">Coffee Cultivation</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Coffee cultivation requires specific environmental conditions and careful management practices to ensure optimal
      growth and yield. Key aspects of coffee cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Climate:</li>
        Coffee thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, with consistent temperatures between 15째C to 25째C (59째F to
        77째F). Regions with distinct wet and dry seasons are ideal for coffee cultivation, as it promotes flowering and
        fruit development.<br><br>
        <li>Altitude:</li>
        Altitude plays a crucial role in coffee cultivation, with higher elevations generally producing higher quality
        beans. The cooler temperatures and slower maturation process at higher altitudes contribute to the development
        of complex flavors in coffee beans.<br><br>
        <li>Soil:</li>
        Coffee plants prefer well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. Acidic soils with a pH range of 6.0 to
        6.5 are ideal for coffee cultivation, as they promote nutrient uptake and prevent nutrient deficiencies.<br><br>
        <li>Shade:</li>
        Shade-grown coffee is becoming increasingly popular due to its environmental sustainability and impact on flavor
        development. Shade trees provide protection from direct sunlight, promote biodiversity, and enhance soil
        moisture retention, resulting in higher quality coffee beans.<br><br>
        <li>Water:</li>
        Adequate water availability is essential for coffee cultivation, especially during the flowering and fruiting
        stages. While coffee plants require regular watering, they are sensitive to waterlogged conditions, which can
        lead to root rot and decreased yield.
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Harvesting and Processing</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      The harvesting and processing of coffee beans are critical steps that impact the final flavor and quality of the
      brewed coffee. Common methods of coffee processing include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Washed Process:</li>
        In the washed process, ripe coffee cherries are pulped to remove the outer skin, fermented to break down the
        mucilage, and then washed and dried. This method produces clean and bright coffee with pronounced acidity and
        clarity of flavor.<br><br>
        <li>Natural Process:</li>
        In the natural process, ripe coffee cherries are dried whole with the fruit intact, allowing the beans to
        absorb sugars and flavors from the pulp. This method results in a sweeter and fruitier cup with more body and
        complexity.<br><br>
        <li>Honey Process:</li>
        The honey process involves removing the outer skin of ripe coffee cherries and drying them with varying degrees
        of mucilage left intact. This method produces coffee with a distinct sweetness and a range of flavor profiles,
        depending on the amount of mucilage retained.<br><br>
        <li>Anaerobic Fermentation:</li>
        Anaerobic fermentation is a specialized processing method where coffee cherries are fermented in an oxygen-free
        environment, allowing for unique flavor development and complexity. This method is often used to create
        experimental and specialty coffee lots prized by enthusiasts.
