    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Sorghum crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Sorghum, also known as milo, is a versatile cereal grain with multiple uses, including human consumption, animal
      feed, and biofuel production. Sorghum is well-suited to arid and semi-arid regions, making it an important crop
      for food security in drought-prone areas. Cultivated by farmers worldwide, sorghum production plays a vital role
      in agricultural economies and rural livelihoods. From the vast fields of Africa to the plains of the Americas,
      sorghum cultivation encompasses a rich diversity of varieties and farming practices. This introduction explores
      the cultivation, uses, and significance of sorghum as a staple crop for millions of people around the world.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Sorghum cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Sorghum is
      well-adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with optimal growth occurring in temperatures ranging from 25째C to
      35째C (77째F to 95째F). It is relatively drought-tolerant compared to other cereal crops, making it suitable for
      regions with limited water availability. Sorghum requires well-drained soils with good moisture retention
      capacity. Ideal soil types include sandy loam or clay loam with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Sorghum is sensitive
      to waterlogging, so proper drainage is essential to prevent root rot and other water-related diseases. While
      sorghum can tolerate high temperatures and drought, it also benefits from adequate moisture during critical
      growth stages such as germination, flowering, and grain filling. Sorghum is a sun-loving crop that requires
      full sun exposure for optimal growth and development. Adequate sunlight ensures vigorous vegetative growth and
      promotes grain formation. Sorghum cultivation is generally less reliant on high humidity levels compared to other
      cereal crops. Moderate humidity levels, typically between 40% to 60%, are suitable for sorghum growth and
      development. Excessive humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases such as anthracnose and downy mildew.

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Sorghum crops are susceptible to various insect pests, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Sorghum Midge:</li> Small flies that lay eggs in sorghum flowers, leading to damaged seeds and reduced
        yields.
        <li>Sorghum Headworm:</li> Larvae feed on sorghum grain, reducing yield and quality.
        <li>Aphids:</li> Sap-sucking insects that weaken sorghum plants and transmit viral diseases.
        <li>Stalk Borers:</li> Larvae bore into sorghum stems, causing lodging and reduced grain quality.
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in sorghum cultivation. Farmers utilize a
      range of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect sorghum crops from pests and ensure optimal yield
      and quality.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Sorghum crops benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      yield. Commonly used fertilizers for sorghum cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Essential for vegetative growth and grain formation. Urea or ammonium sulfate are commonly
        used nitrogen fertilizers in sorghum cultivation.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Important for root development and early growth. Single superphosphate or diammonium
        phosphate are commonly used phosphorus fertilizers in sorghum cultivation.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to overall plant health and stress tolerance. Muriate of potash (potassium
        chloride) is a popular potassium fertilizer for sorghum crops.
        <li>Micronutrients:</li> Supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, boron, and manganese may be applied to correct
        deficiencies and improve sorghum crop health and productivity.
