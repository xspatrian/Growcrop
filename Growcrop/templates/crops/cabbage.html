    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Cabbage crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Cabbage is a leafy green or purple biennial plant, grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads.
      Cabbages are a common part of salads, coleslaw, and other dishes. Cabbage can be grown in various climates and
      has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is a hardy crop that can withstand cooler temperatures, making
      it suitable for cultivation in both temperate and subtropical regions. This introduction explores the
      cultivation, varieties, and uses of cabbage in agriculture and culinary practices.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Cabbage cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. The following
      are key specifications for successful cabbage cultivation:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Cabbage grows best in cool temperatures, ideally between 15째C to 20째C (59째F to 68째F). Cooler temperatures
        promote the formation of firm heads and prevent premature bolting. However, cabbage can tolerate a wide range
        of temperatures, but extreme heat can cause bolting and reduce head quality.<br><br>

        <li>Water:</li> Adequate moisture is essential for cabbage growth, particularly during head formation. Cabbage
        requires consistent soil moisture to prevent heads from becoming loose or splitting. However, excessive
        moisture can lead to diseases such as damping-off and clubroot.<br><br>

        <li>Soil:</li> Cabbage prefers well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. Loamy soils with a pH
        between 6.0 to 7.5 are ideal for cabbage cultivation. Proper soil preparation, including adequate drainage
        and soil amendment, is crucial for healthy cabbage growth and development.<br><br>

        <li>Sunlight:</li> Cabbage requires full sun exposure for optimal growth and head development. Adequate
        sunlight ensures compact, dense heads with uniform color and flavor. However, cabbage can tolerate partial
        shade, especially in hot climates, to prevent sunscald and bolting.<br><br>

        <li>Humidity:</li> While cabbage is not as sensitive to humidity as some other crops, moderate humidity levels
        between 40% to 60% are generally favorable for cabbage cultivation. High humidity can increase the risk of
        fungal diseases such as powdery mildew and downy mildew.<br><br>

        <li>Rainfall:</li> Cabbage cultivation typically relies on well-distributed rainfall or supplemental
        irrigation. Adequate moisture is crucial during head formation and maturation to ensure firm, compact heads
        with good texture and flavor. However, excessive rainfall can lead to waterlogging and increase the risk of
        diseases.<br><br>
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Cabbage crops are susceptible to various insect attacks, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Cabbage Worms:</li> Larvae of various moth species, including cabbage loopers and diamondback moths, feed
        on cabbage leaves, causing significant damage to foliage and reducing yield.<br>
        <li>Cabbage Maggots:</li> Larvae of the cabbage maggot tunnel into cabbage roots, causing wilting, stunting,
        and reduced plant vigor.<br>
        <li>Aphids:</li> Sap-sucking insects that feed on cabbage leaves, causing curling, distortion, and yellowing
        of foliage. Aphids can also transmit viral diseases.<br>
        <li>Cabbage Flea Beetles:</li> Small, black beetles that feed on cabbage leaves, creating small, shot-hole
        damage and reducing plant vigor.<br>
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in cabbage cultivation. Farmers utilize a
      range of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect cabbage crops from pests and ensure optimal yield
      and quality.
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Cabbage crops benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      yield. Commonly used fertilizers for cabbage cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Essential for promoting leafy growth and head development. Nitrogen fertilizers such
        as ammonium sulfate or calcium nitrate are commonly used in cabbage cultivation.<br>
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Important for root development and early plant growth. Phosphorus fertilizers such
        as superphosphate or bone meal are beneficial for cabbage crops.<br>
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to overall plant health and disease resistance. Potassium fertilizers
        such as potassium sulfate or potassium nitrate are used to promote cabbage growth and quality.<br>
        <li>Micronutrients:</li> Supplemental micronutrients such as boron, manganese, and zinc may be applied to
        correct deficiencies and improve cabbage crop health and productivity.<br>
