    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Bell peppers require specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. The following are key specifications for successful bell pepper cultivation:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Bell peppers thrive in warm temperatures, typically between 21°C to 29°C (70°F to 84°F). The optimal temperature range promotes vigorous growth and fruit development, while temperatures below 15°C (59°F) can slow growth and affect fruit quality.<br><br>
        <li>Water:</li>
        Bell peppers require consistent soil moisture throughout their growing season. Adequate irrigation is essential, especially during periods of drought or dry spells, to ensure optimal growth and fruit production.<br><br>
        <li>Soil:</li>
        Bell peppers grow best in well-drained, fertile soils with good water retention capacity. Sandy loam or loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 are ideal for bell pepper cultivation. Soil rich in organic matter promotes healthy root development and enhances nutrient uptake by the plants.<br><br>
        <li>Sunlight:</li>
        Bell peppers require ample sunlight for photosynthesis and fruiting. Full sun exposure is preferable, although they can tolerate partial shade. Adequate sunlight ensures robust plant growth, flower formation, and fruit development.<br><br>
        <li>Humidity:</li>
        Bell peppers thrive in moderate humidity levels, typically between 40% to 70%. High humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases, so proper ventilation is important.<br><br>
        <li>Wind:</li>
        Bell pepper plants are relatively sturdy but can be damaged by strong winds. Windbreaks such as fences or hedgerows can help protect them from wind damage.
      </ol>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Bell peppers are vulnerable to various insect pests that can damage the plants and reduce yields. Common insect attacks on bell peppers include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Aphids:</li> These sap-sucking insects can weaken bell pepper plants and transmit viral diseases.<br><br>
        <li>Spider Mites:</li> Spider mites feed on the underside of bell pepper leaves, causing stippling and leaf damage.<br><br>
        <li>Whiteflies:</li> Whiteflies feed on bell pepper leaves, reducing plant vigor and transmitting plant diseases.<br><br>
        <li>Thrips:</li> Thrips feed on bell pepper leaves and flowers, causing silvering or bronzing of the foliage and reducing photosynthetic activity.
      </ol>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in bell pepper cultivation. Farmers use a variety of insecticides, fungicides, and miticides to protect bell pepper plants and ensure optimal fruit production. Integrated pest management practices are important to minimize environmental impact and ensure the safety of workers and consumers.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Bell peppers benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements and support healthy growth and fruiting. Commonly used fertilizers for bell pepper cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Nitrogen is essential for leaf and stem growth, as well as fruit development. Nitrogen fertilizers such as urea or ammonium sulfate are commonly used to promote vigorous vegetative growth and enhance fruit yield.<br><br>
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Phosphorus is important for root development and overall plant vigor. Phosphorus fertilizers such as diammonium phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate help establish healthy root systems and improve fruit quality.<br><br>
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Potassium is essential for fruit development, ripening, and disease resistance. Potassium fertilizers such as muriate of potash or potassium sulfate are used to ensure proper fruit development and enhance shelf life.<br><br>
        <li>Calcium (Ca):</li> Calcium is important for cell wall structure and fruit quality. Calcium fertilizers such as calcium nitrate or gypsum can help prevent disorders like blossom end rot in bell peppers.
