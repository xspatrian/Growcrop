    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Peanuts crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Peanuts, also known as groundnuts or Arachis hypogaea, are a versatile legume crop grown worldwide for their edible
      seeds. Cultivated by millions of farmers across diverse agro-climatic regions, peanuts are valued for their high
      nutritional content, oil extraction, and culinary uses. Peanuts play a crucial role in global food security,
      providing protein-rich sustenance for humans and livestock alike. From the sandy soils of the southern United
      States to the arid landscapes of Africa and beyond, peanut cultivation encompasses a rich tapestry of traditions,
      techniques, and agricultural practices passed down through generations. For farmers, peanuts represent not only a
      source of income and sustenance but also a deeply ingrained cultural heritage and way of life. This introduction
      explores the intricate art of peanut cultivation, delving into the methods, challenges, and significance of
      growing this vital crop for farmers around the world.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Peanuts cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Peanuts thrive
      in warm temperatures, typically between 20째C to 30째C (68째F to 86째F). The optimal temperature for peanuts
      cultivation varies depending on the variety and growth stage. Warm temperatures promote healthy vegetative growth,
      flowering, and pod development, while cooler temperatures can slow growth and delay maturity. Peanuts are
      moderately drought-tolerant but require consistent soil moisture, especially during critical growth stages such as
      flowering and pod filling. Well-drained sandy loam soils with good water-holding capacity are ideal for peanuts
      cultivation. Peanuts are relatively tolerant of acidic soils but prefer slightly acidic to neutral pH levels,
      typically between 6.0 to 7.0. Adequate sunlight is essential for peanut growth and development. Peanuts require
      full sun exposure for optimal yield and quality. However, they can tolerate partial shade, especially during
      early growth stages. Peanuts cultivation is generally less reliant on high humidity levels compared to crops like
      rice. Moderate humidity levels, typically between 50% to 70%, are suitable for peanut growth and development.
      Excessive humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases, particularly during flowering and pod formation
      stages. Peanuts are sensitive to excessive moisture, especially during pod filling, which can lead to fungal
      infections and reduced yield.

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Peanuts crops are susceptible to various insect pests, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Aphids:</li> Sap-sucking insects that weaken plants and transmit viral diseases.
        <li>Thrips:</li> Tiny insects that feed on peanut leaves and transmit viral diseases, causing leaf curling and
        stunted growth.
        <li>Armyworms:</li> Larvae feed on peanut foliage, causing defoliation and yield loss.
        <li>Leafhoppers:</li> Piercing-sucking insects that transmit viral diseases and cause leaf yellowing and
        distortion.
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in peanut cultivation. Farmers utilize a range
      of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect peanut crops from pests and ensure optimal yield and
      quality.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Peanuts crops benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      yield. Commonly used fertilizers for peanuts cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Important for vegetative growth, pod development, and yield. Nitrogen fertilizers such
        as urea or ammonium sulfate are commonly used in peanuts cultivation.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Essential for root development, flowering, and pod formation. Phosphorus fertilizers
        such as diammonium phosphate (DAP) or triple superphosphate are commonly used in peanuts cultivation.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to overall plant health, stress tolerance, and pod filling. Potassium
        fertilizers such as muriate of potash (potassium chloride) are commonly used in peanuts cultivation.
        <li>Micronutrients:</li> Supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, manganese, and boron may be applied to
        correct deficiencies and improve peanut crop health and productivity.
