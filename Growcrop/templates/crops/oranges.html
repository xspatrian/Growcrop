    <h4 class="heading">Introduction to Oranges crop</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Oranges, a citrus fruit known for their tangy flavor and nutritional benefits, are cultivated in many regions around
      the world. The orange tree is prized not only for its fruit but also for its fragrant blossoms and evergreen
      foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental and commercial purposes. From the sun-drenched orchards of
      California to the groves of Spain and beyond, orange cultivation encompasses a rich tradition of horticulture
      and agricultural practices passed down through generations. This introduction explores the cultivation methods,
      challenges, and significance of growing oranges, a beloved fruit cherished for its taste and health benefits.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Oranges cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Oranges thrive
      in subtropical to tropical climates, typically characterized by mild winters and warm, humid summers. The
      following are key environmental factors required for successful oranges cultivation:
      <br><br>

      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Oranges thrive in temperatures between 15째C to 30째C (59째F to 86째F). Mild winters and warm summers are ideal
        for orange trees, promoting fruit development and ripening.
        <li>Water:</li>
        Adequate water supply is essential for oranges cultivation, particularly during fruit development and ripening.
        Oranges are typically grown in regions with well-distributed rainfall or access to irrigation.
        <li>Soil:</li>
        Oranges grow best in well-drained, fertile soils with good water retention capacity. Sandy loam or loamy soils
        with a slightly acidic to neutral pH are ideal for orange trees.
        <li>Sunlight:</li>
        Oranges require ample sunlight for fruit production and quality. Full sun exposure is preferred for optimal
        growth and fruit development.
        <li>Humidity:</li>
        Moderate to high humidity levels are beneficial for oranges cultivation, particularly during the flowering and
        fruit-setting stages. However, excessive humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases.
        <li>Rainfall:</li>
        Well-distributed rainfall or supplemental irrigation is necessary for oranges cultivation, especially during
        dry periods or droughts.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Oranges crops are susceptible to various insect attacks, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Citrus Whiteflies:</li>
        Sap-sucking insects that weaken orange trees and transmit viral diseases.
        <li>Citrus Leafminers:</li>
        Larvae feed on young leaves, causing leaf curling and stunted growth.
        <li>Citrus Psyllids:</li>
        Insects that feed on orange leaves and transmit a bacterium that causes citrus greening disease.
        <li>Scale Insects:</li>
        Pests that attach to orange trees and feed on sap, leading to leaf yellowing and reduced vigor.
      </ol>
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in oranges cultivation. Farmers utilize a
      range of insecticides, fungicides, and miticides to protect orange trees from pests and ensure optimal fruit
      production and quality.
    </h6>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Orange trees benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      fruit development. Commonly used fertilizers for oranges cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li>
        Essential for vegetative growth and fruit development. Nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate or urea
        are commonly used in oranges orchards.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li>
        Important for root development and fruit setting. Phosphorus fertilizers like diammonium phosphate (DAP) or
        triple superphosphate are applied to improve fruit quality and yield.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li>
        Contributes to overall tree health and fruit quality. Potassium fertilizers such as potassium chloride or
        potassium sulfate are used to enhance fruit flavor and size.
        <li>Micronutrients:</li>
        Supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, manganese, and boron may be applied to correct deficiencies and
        improve orange tree health and productivity.
