    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Guava, a tropical fruit with a unique flavor profile, is cultivated in various regions worldwide for its nutritional
      value and versatility. Successful guava cultivation relies on specific environmental conditions and management
      practices to achieve optimal yields and quality. Cultivated by millions of farmers worldwide, guava production
      sustains economies, provides livelihoods, and contributes to food security. From the tropical orchards of
      Latin America to the smallholder farms of Asia and Africa, guava cultivation encompasses a rich diversity of
      varieties, cultivation methods, and cultural practices. For farmers, guavas represent not only a source of
      income but also a way of life deeply rooted in tradition and community. This introduction explores the intricate
      art of guava cultivation, delving into the methods, challenges, and significance of growing this beloved fruit
      for farmers around the world.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Guavas require specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. The following are key
      specifications for successful guava cultivation:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Temperature:</li>
        Guavas thrive in warm temperatures, typically between 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F). The optimal temperature
        range promotes vigorous growth and fruit development, while temperatures below 10°C (50°F) can hinder growth and
        affect fruit quality.<br><br>
        <li>Water:</li>
        Guavas are relatively drought-tolerant once established but require consistent soil moisture during their
        initial growth stages. Adequate irrigation is essential, especially during dry spells, to ensure optimal growth
        and fruit production.<br><br>
        <li>Soil:</li>
        Guavas grow best in well-drained, fertile soils with a pH range of 4.5 to 7.0. Sandy loam or loamy soils are
        ideal for guava cultivation. Soil rich in organic matter promotes healthy root development and enhances
        nutrient uptake by the plants.<br><br>
        <li>Sunlight:</li>
        Guavas require full sun exposure for optimal growth and fruiting. Adequate sunlight ensures robust plant growth,
        flower formation, and fruit development.<br><br>
        <li>Humidity:</li>
        Guavas prefer moderate to high humidity levels, ideally between 60% to 80%. High humidity promotes optimal
        growth, flowering, and fruit set. However, good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases.<br><br>
        <li>Wind:</li>
        Guava trees can withstand moderate winds, but strong winds can damage branches and fruit. Windbreaks such as
        hedges or tall trees can provide protection against wind damage.
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Guavas are susceptible to various insect pests that can damage the plants and reduce yields. Common insect attacks
      on guavas include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Guava Fruit Fly:</li> These pests lay their eggs in developing guava fruits, leading to fruit damage and
        premature dropping.<br><br>
        <li>Guava Whitefly:</li> Whiteflies feed on guava leaves, causing leaf yellowing, stunted growth, and reduced
        fruit quality.<br><br>
        <li>Red-banded Thrips:</li> Thrips feed on guava leaves, causing silvering or bronzing of the foliage and
        reducing photosynthetic activity.<br><br>
        <li>Guava Moth:</li> Moth larvae tunnel into guava fruits, causing damage and promoting fungal infections.
      </ol>

    <br><br>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in guava cultivation. Farmers use a variety
      of insecticides, fungicides, and miticides to protect guava plants and ensure optimal fruit production. Integrated
      pest management practices are important to minimize environmental impact and ensure the safety of workers and
      consumers.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Guavas benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements and support healthy growth and
      fruiting. Commonly used fertilizers for guava cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Nitrogen is important for vegetative growth and fruit development. Nitrogen fertilizers
        such as ammonium sulfate or calcium nitrate are commonly used to promote lush foliage and fruit set.<br><br>
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Phosphorus aids in root development and flowering. Phosphorus fertilizers such as
        superphosphate or bone meal help establish strong root systems and improve fruiting.<br><br>
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Potassium is essential for fruit development and disease resistance. Potassium
        fertilizers such as potassium chloride or potassium sulfate are used to enhance fruit quality and shelf life.<br><br>
        <li>Micro-nutrients:</li> Guava plants may require supplemental micronutrients such as zinc, iron, manganese,
        and copper for optimal growth and productivity. Micronutrient fertilizers can correct deficiencies and improve
        plant health and yield.
