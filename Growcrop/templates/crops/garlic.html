    <h6 class="inner">
      Garlic, a widely used culinary ingredient with medicinal properties, is cultivated worldwide for its flavorful bulbs
      and health benefits. With a history spanning thousands of years, garlic holds a prominent place in various
      cuisines and cultures, prized for its distinct taste and potential health-promoting properties. Cultivated by
      farmers across different continents, garlic production sustains economies, provides livelihoods, and contributes
      to global food security. From the small backyard gardens to large commercial farms, garlic cultivation involves a
      diverse range of techniques and practices tailored to different climates and growing conditions. This
      introduction explores the fascinating world of garlic cultivation, delving into its cultural significance,
      agricultural practices, and the culinary and medicinal uses that make it a staple in kitchens and medicine
      cabinets around the world.

    <h4 class="heading">Specification</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Garlic cultivation requires specific environmental conditions to thrive and produce optimal yields. Garlic thrives
      in cool temperate climates, typically between 12째C to 24째C (54째F to 75째F). The optimal temperature for garlic
      cultivation varies depending on the variety and growth stage. Cool temperatures during the early stages promote
      bulb formation, while warmer temperatures during the later stages encourage growth and maturation. Garlic is
      moderately water-intensive and requires well-drained soil with consistent moisture throughout the growing
      season. Adequate soil moisture is crucial during bulb development to ensure plump, healthy cloves. Garlic grows
      best in loose, well-drained soils rich in organic matter, with a pH range between 6.0 to 7.5. Soil fertility
      plays a vital role in garlic cultivation, with balanced nutrition essential for healthy plant growth and bulb
      development. Garlic prefers full sun exposure but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hot climates, to
      avoid heat stress and sunburn. Proper air circulation is essential to prevent disease and ensure the health of
      garlic plants. High humidity levels can promote fungal diseases, so maintaining adequate airflow is crucial,
      especially during the growing season and storage. While garlic is relatively drought-tolerant, supplemental
      irrigation may be necessary during dry spells to ensure consistent soil moisture and optimal bulb development.

    <h4 class="heading">Insect Attacks</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Garlic crops are susceptible to various insect pests, including:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Garlic Root Maggots:</li> Larvae feed on garlic roots, leading to weakened plants and reduced yields.
        <li>Thrips:</li> Tiny insects that feed on garlic leaves and bulbs, causing damage and reducing plant vigor.
        <li>Onion Flies:</li> Larvae feed on garlic bulbs, leading to rot and decay.
        <li>Wireworms:</li> Larvae feed on garlic roots and bulbs, causing stunted growth and yield loss.
      </ol>

    <h4 class="heading">Pesticides</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Pesticides play a crucial role in managing insect pests and diseases in garlic cultivation. Farmers utilize a
      range of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to protect garlic crops from pests and ensure optimal yield
      and quality.

    <h4 class="heading">Fertilizer</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6 class="inner">
      Garlic crops benefit from balanced fertilization to meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and
      yield. Commonly used fertilizers for garlic cultivation include:
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):</li> Important for vegetative growth and bulb formation. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers such as
        urea or ammonium sulfate are commonly used in garlic cultivation.
        <li>Phosphorus (P):</li> Essential for root development and overall plant vigor. Phosphorus fertilizers like
        diammonium phosphate (DAP) or bone meal are beneficial for garlic crops.
        <li>Potassium (K):</li> Contributes to bulb development and disease resistance. Potassium-rich fertilizers such
        as potassium sulfate or wood ash are suitable for garlic cultivation.
        <li>Organic Matter:</li> Compost or well-rotted manure can improve soil structure and provide essential
        nutrients for garlic plants.
      </ol>
